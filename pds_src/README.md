# Super Robin Hood NES Source Code 
The official Quattro Adventure's Super Robin Hood source code written in PDS and given away by The Oliver Twins to the Wireframe Magazine.
PDS is an old Development System featuring a cross-platform assembler, debugger and all the tools required to build software.
Even with the executables for PDS we do not have any way to actually assemble the code, as assembly requires specialized hardware which connects to the target machine.
If you would like to find an assemblable version, check out the rewrite that I'm working on in the meantime (if it's even finished, that is!).

Happy code reading!
